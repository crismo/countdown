# Countdown
The Countdown Tool is a simple web application that displays a countdown timer. You can use it to count down to a specific time or event.


## Usage
To use the tool, simply add time durations in the form of hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s) to the query parameters. If you want to display a specific message at the end of the countdown, use the query parameter msg.

Here are some examples:

- Count down 15 seconds: `https://crismo.github.io/countdown/?s=15`
- Count down 2 hours and 30 minutes: `https://crismo.github.io/countdown/?h=2&m=30`
- Count down 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 seconds, and say "Boo!": `https://crismo.github.io/countdown/?h=1&m=30&s=15&msg=Boo!`

Alternativly there is a button in the left upper corner that toggles a simple settings UI.
